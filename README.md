This is one of the machine learning projects that I had done during my 
internship at Mentorness. The main objective of the project isto make 
a machine learning model based on a given dataset to predict churn 
that can happen based on some relevant factors like tenure of a 
customer with the service provider, type of contract, monthly and 
yearly bills etc. Predicting customer churn is an important for any 
organization as acquiring customers is much costly than retaining 
them. Hence, identifying then beforehand and taking adequate 
actions by employing customer retention strategies is crucial for 
reducing revenue loss and prolonged customer satisfaction.
Throughout the project, I have done following steps:
1. Data cleaning
2. Data wrangling
3. EDA
4. Preprocessing
5. Model development
6. Model selection
7. Recommendations
